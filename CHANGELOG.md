# Changelog

## 1.0.2

- Discover: the model list takes 40% of the area (at least 380 pt, detail at least 400) instead of whatever width the split view started with, which left it squeezed in large windows. The divider is still draggable and its position is remembered.
- Discover: "Runnable only" and the model count stay on one line in narrow windows.

## 1.0.1

- The window opens at 1280×820 on first launch instead of at its minimum width, which squeezed the Discover screen and the chat.
- The sidebar keeps at least 240 pt and the main area at least 820 pt (chat 560 + settings inspector 260). The window can't shrink below the sum, so neither side gets compressed.
- Discover's model badges move to a second row when the pane is narrow instead of breaking mid-word.

## 1.0.0

First public release.

- Native macOS app (SwiftUI, Apple silicon) to discover, download and chat with MLX models from Hugging Face.
- From-scratch Metal inference engine for `llama`, `mistral`, `qwen2`, `qwen3` and `phi3` models with 2–8-bit MLX quantization: fused 4-bit decode kernels, simdgroup-matrix prefill, flash attention, KV-cache prefix reuse. Mistral 7B decodes at 38.6 tok/s on an M2 Pro (82% of its memory bandwidth).
- Qwen3 thinking mode, Markdown chat with code highlighting, edit/regenerate, searchable history.
- OpenAI-compatible local server: Responses API, Chat Completions, Completions; Host/Origin checks, optional API key (required in LAN mode), limits and timeouts.
- `mlxr` CLI: search, download, run, serve, bench.
- Downloads resume with HTTP ranges and are SHA-256 verified; the Hugging Face token lives in the Keychain.
- Signed in-app updates (Ed25519-signed SHA256SUMS, SHA-256, code-signature check, atomic swap).
